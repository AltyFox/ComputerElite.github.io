                        No. You're downloading from Oculus servers and those check that you own the game

                    <div class="guideHeader" style="text-align:left; padding: 5px; text-decoration: underline;">Important info about tokens</div>
                    <div class="guideSteps" style="text-align:left; padding: 10px;">
                        Your token is something private. Anyone who has it can download apps, send messages, ... with your name.
                        <br/>But then the question comes why do I give it Rift downgrader? Rift downgrader needs to authenticate the download with oculus so it needs your token. After you entered the token it gets stored locally on your PC and ONLY shared with an official tool by Oculus to download rift apps.

You'll be asked where your Oculus game libary is located. If you don't remember changing that then just hit enter, otherwise type the full path to your library. Your game should be copied (as Oculus doesn't allow games to start from other folders) and then be launched.
