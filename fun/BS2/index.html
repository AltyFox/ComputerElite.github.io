                <h1>MORE INFO</h1>
                As you all have probably became aware of, Meta has purchased all of Rock Star North 
                (not affiliated with Rockstar North) and have replaced Beat Games with them. As of 
                todays date, Beat Games no longer has ANY rights to the Beat Saber IP.
                <h2>WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?</h2>
                It means you get more of the game that you love! We understand that <i>big</i> changes aren't always the best, but we have ensured to listen to every single word spoken by
                the loving Beat Saber community. Below is a list of the new awesome changes that are
                coming to Beat Saber 2!
                <ul>
                    <li>A whole new experience!</li>
                    <li>An even bigger community!</li>
                    <li>Even more graphics!</li>
                    <li>Enhanced updates!</li>

                <h1>NEW FEATURES</h1>
                <h2>Easy Anti Cheat</h2>
                Goodbye cheaters! As other games have been implementing this feature, we thought it's time we do as well. This simple tool will prevent all future cheating issues with its extremely advanced, hard-to-crack, cheating prevention methods.

                <h2>Beat Sage</h2>
                We know you Meta Quest users have been promised custom songs for quite a long while… so here it is! Using this incredibly advanced AI technology, simply handing it a song file, it is able to create any level you could want! This feature will completely replace normal custom songs entirely, as you can now make as many songs as you want with ease. You will be able to share BeatSage songs through the Rock Star Club app.
